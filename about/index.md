Medical imaging is so fascinating that I would like to devote my career on solving all the variety of chanllenging problems in this field. Medical image anaysis is closely related to a lot of fields, such as computer vision, image analysis, machine learning, statistics, and even computation geometry. 

One one hand, theories, algorithms, or methodologies in different fields could find important applications in medical imaging. For instance, alpha shape (a classic concept in computational geometry) can be used to segment cells in fibrin networks ([link](http://proceedings.spiedigitallibrary.org/proceeding.aspx?articleid=1345967)). Another famous example is level set, a widely studied problem in numerical partial differential equations, which obtained tremendous success in medical image segmentation ([link](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1467299&url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D1467299)).

On the other hand, medical imaging problems are far beyond simply applications. For example, object tracking is a common problem in computer vision. However, algorithms for general object tracking in natrual scene images cannot be simply applied in tracking bio-medical targets, like cells or bacteria. One of my early works was to develop a new cell tracking algorithm taking inspirations from computer vision and graph theory ([link](http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-10470-6_15#page-1)).

Recently, deep learning has ...
