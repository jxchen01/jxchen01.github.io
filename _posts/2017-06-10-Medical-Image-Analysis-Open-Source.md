I use this page to keep track of available open source tools for biomedical image analysis, e.g. registration, segmentation, pre-processing, etc..

* Four toolsets developed by Andriy Myronenko, [Link](https://sites.google.com/site/myronenko/research)
* COPAP: Cyclic Order Preserving Assignment Problem, [Link](https://web.archive.org/web/20160403232409/http://dsp.rice.edu:80/software/copap)
* A good platform for comparing multiple level set methods, [Link](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/27745-active-contour-platform)
* ilastik, [Link](http://ilastik.org/)
* A better matlab routine for computing region centerline, [Link](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/11123-better-skeletonization)
* Bresenham algorithm (computing the grid coordinates of points alongs the line connecting two given points) in Matlab, [Link](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/28190-bresenham-optimized-for-matlab)
* Frangi filter (computing vesselness) in Matlab, [Link](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/24409-hessian-based-frangi-vesselness-filter)
* A nice implementation of 2D/3D Snake, [Link](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/28149-snake---active-contour)
