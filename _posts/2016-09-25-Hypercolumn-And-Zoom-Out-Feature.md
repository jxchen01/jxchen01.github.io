## Summary

These two papers appear before the well-known fully convolutional network (FCN). I feel the core spirit of FCN was already well formulated in these two papers. 


The motivation is that in the conv-net, the early layers have smaller receptive field, and the deep layers have larger receptive field. Then, if we want to classify each pixel, or a superpixel, or even a small region, we want to take information at different scales (i.e., different receptive field sizes). 

The idea is illustrated in the picture below.

After downsampling, the size of the feature maps is not of the same scale as the original image. To associate the information at this scale with each pixel in the original image grid, upsampling is performed.

Zoom-out features essentially mean that we collect the features from receptive field of different sizes centered at the same position. It can be viewed as "zooming out" from a particular pixel (or superpixel) up to a very large context. 


## Related Papers

When the first time I read the following two papers, I was so surprised that why they perform much better than FCN or U-Net. The structure seems to be a "simple" extention of FCN. After I read the aforementioned two papers related to hypercolumn, I finally understand the consideration behind the design.
