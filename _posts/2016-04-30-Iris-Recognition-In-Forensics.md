# Iris Recognition In Forensics 

I developed an iris recognition method based on detecting and matching of human interpretable features (i.e., crypts), which can be seamlessly integrated into [the human-in-the-loop iris recognition framwork]((http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=6835998)) proposed by Feng Shen and Prof. Flynn.

### Motivation:
In law-enforcement applications, iris is a (arguablly) less well-established biometric trait than fingerprint. Classic iris recognition algorithms work as a black-box: images in and scores out. One possible way to promote iris recognition in the field of forensics is to make the identification procedure visible and interpretable to human, just like fingerprint matching, and so that human experts can excercise judgement in making the final decision. It has been shown that iris crypts can work just like minutia on fingerprints ([paper](http://proceedings.spiedigitallibrary.org/proceeding.aspx?articleid=1693595)).

### Methodology

Our approach consists of two steps: detection and matching.
