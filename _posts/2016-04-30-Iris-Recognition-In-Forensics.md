# Iris Recognition In Forensics 

I developed an iris recognition method based on detecting the matching of human interpretable features (i.e., crypts), which can be seamlessly integrated into [the human-in-the-loop iris recognition framwork]((http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=6835998)) proposed by Feng Shen and Prof. Flynn. 

### Motivation:
Iris is a (arguablly) less well-established biometric trait than fingerprint in law-enforment applications. Classic iris recognition algorithms work as a black-box: images in and scores out. One possible way to promote iris recognition in forensics is to make the identification procedute visible and interpretable to human, just like fingerprint matching. It has been shown that iris crypts can work just like minutia on fingerprints ([paper](http://proceedings.spiedigitallibrary.org/proceeding.aspx?articleid=1693595)).
