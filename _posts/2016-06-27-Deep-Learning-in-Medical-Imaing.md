# Deep Learning in Medical Imaing

In the recent five years, deep learning has become a game changer in lots of engineering fields. Medical imaging is fountunately (or "unfortunately") one of these fields. Deep learning has become the dominating tool in numerouse applications, such as object detection (see this recent survey-like [paper](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.03409v1.pdf)), classification (recent nature [paper](http://www.nature.com/articles/srep21471)), diagonsis (e.g. [breast cancer](https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-applies-deep-learning-technology-to-diagnostic-ultrasound-imaging)), and much more.
