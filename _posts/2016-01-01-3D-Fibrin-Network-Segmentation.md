title:  "3D Fibrin Network Segmentation"
date:   2016-01-30
excerpt: "Quantifying the morphology and topology of 3D fibrin network is important to study thromus. I deviced a simply but effective algorithm for the segmentation of interlacing 3D tubular structures, as well as the identification and analysis of the network structure."
