# XGBoost on Windows 7

I am trying to perform some experiments using XGBoost for a complex classification problem. [XGBoost](https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost) is a new boosting tree algorithm in machine learning and has achieved huge success in several big data competitions. 

To setup XGBoost on Windows 7, I strictly followed this [instruction](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/blogs/jfp/entry/Installing_XGBoost_For_Anaconda_on_Windows?lang=en#action=addcomment). One issue (should be solved soon officially) is [here](https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost/issues/1267). Everything works fine now.

Let's Rock!

The following two tutorials on how to tuning the parameters can be useful.
